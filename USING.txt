I'm not going to write a nice manual for this.

**** getting help inside nisprog
In nisprog, you can do either
"help <whatever_command>"
or
"commandname ?" to get descriptions and help etc. I think the rest should be pretty self-explanatory.

**** command availability vs npkern
The main idea is that some commands only work if the ECU is running npkern (see github.com/fenugrec/npkern ) :
		flverif
		flblock
		flrom
OTOH, "dumpmem" works always, but is way way faster with npkern running.

For that, you'll need an npkern kernel (compiled of course, maybe npkern_7058.bin ). See "runkernel" command

**** If you get in trouble (weird errors, etc)
"debug l1 0x8c" will show sent/received data.
try adjusting timing, etc.
If you want me to help, I'll need
		full console output (previous commands, all errors etc)
		nisprog version
		OS, K line hardware / drivers, etc.

filing issues on GitHub is ok. Or you can post on the RomRaider forums.


**** special "submenu" commands
some commands (like "set", "debug", etc) also act as submenus, i.e.
######
set
interface dumb
port asdfasdf
up
## does the same thing as
set interface dumb
set port asdfasdf
######



Here are some example commands.
Note, these may become invalid as I work on nisprog and forget to update.

#don't really use this one (reflash single block).
#flblock orig_rom.bin 14

#reflash !
flrom whatever_rom.bin

#timing errors ? add some delays with "npconf" and try again.
#Don't panic, and DO NOT POWER OFF THE ECU if you suspect there were write errors !

#all done ? are you sure ? then reset the ECU to leave kernel mode
stopkernel

#and disconnect / quit
npdisc
quit
